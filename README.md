# TPF-and-Kaching-s-Case-Study-Event
TPF and Kaching's Case study event held in Inter IIT Tech meet 9.0.<br> 
This submission won a silver medal.<br>
Problem Statement: Kaching is a company that works for promoting the businesses in restaurants and uses the resaurants' customers for promotion. Everytime a customer refers the restaurant
on any social media platform, their followers can show the referrer's profile to the restaurant and avail a discount. In return for referring Kaching also gives a token of thanks to the
referrers in form of some money via upi payments.<br>
This Presentation proposes a solution to automate the whole process, which is to manage cross-platform messaging ,i.e., sending messages accross any social media platforms: whatsapp, Instagram,
 facebook, discord, etc., and then ask for the referrer's upi Id. The Payout Server then automatically proceeds with the payout and sends a final thank You message to the referrer.
